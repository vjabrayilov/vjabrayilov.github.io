I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [Columbia University](https://columbia.edu) advised by [Kostis Kaffes](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kkaffes/), focusing on systems performance and low-latency computing.

My work spans _networking, operating systems, and machine learning runtimes_, with an emphasis on _CPU and GPU virtualization_. 
I have built high-performance software such as [Machnet](https://github.com/microsoft/machnet), a kernel-bypass networking framework, and interned at [Microsoft Research](https://https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/about-microsoft-research/), where I worked on large-scale infrastructure for data and networking. 

I bring expertise in _C/C++, Rust, CUDA, DPDK and Linux kernel programming_, and my interests lie at the intersection of high-frequency trading systems and large-scale AI platforms, where reliability and speed are critical.
